# Push Instructions

The automated push failed because `git` needs your GitHub credentials, which are not configured in this terminal.

Please run the following command in your terminal to push the code:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If prompted for a username/password:
-   **Username**: Your GitHub username (`hardeepsasan`)
-   **Password**: Your [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (GitHub passwords no longer work for HTTPS).

Once pushed, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/hardeepsasan/IPTV_Emulator/actions) in your repository to see the automation run!
