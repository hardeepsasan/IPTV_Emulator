As he sets about this gruesome task, he comes across an old flame, Kamini, as well as his estranged wife, Sita - and it is these encounters that may well be the turning point in this life that may convince him to leave the bombs and Bandooks behind and spend the rest of his life praying and watching the Bhakti Channel.",

Things deteriorate when she develops an obsession with the local weatherman, which leads to an admission to the nearby psychiatric hospital. Over the years, as she grows up, her daughter Alice struggles to relate to her heavily medicated mum, and causes chaos when she comes up with a plan to reconnect with her, which divides the family forever and leads to a moving climax. Set to the songs of The Smiths, The More You Ignore Me provides a sometimes stark, yet comical insight into life within this quirky household, whilst addressing mental health issues and their impact on the family.",

In the movie version Sarafina feels shame at her mother's (played by Miriam Makeba in the film) acceptance of her role as domestic servant in a white household in apartheid South Africa, and inspires her peers to rise up in protest, especially after her inspirational teacher, Mary Masombuka (played by Whoopi Goldberg in the film version) is imprisoned.",

The object is to free the Realm of Darkhaven from the 13 Demons of the Apocalypse. They chalk it up to urban legend and decide to play, what they don't know is that the 13 Demons presently walk the Earth disguised as humans. Slowly, the game consumes them, seducing them into believing they are \"The Golden Paladins,\" and are on a holy mission to save the world. But when the news reveals a number of local deaths caused by tree branches, baseball bats, hammers, etc. from assailants adorned in body armor, the thin line between reality and fantasy is shattered and the horrific realization that they are in way over their heads sets in.",

It is a retooling of a script originally shot as a 94-minute pilot for a TV series (co-written with TV screenwriter Joyce Eliason) for the channel ABC, which had approved the script, but chose not even to air the pilot once it was done in 1999, despite Lynch's labours to cut the project to their liking. It was left in limbo until 18 month later French company Studio Canal Plus (also producer of 'The Straight Story') agreed to pay ABC $7 million for the pilot, and budget a few million more to turn the pilot into a two-hour, 27-minute movie. The cost of the film doubled to $14 million as sets had to be reconstructed and actors recalled.",

Through interviews with a diverse group of scholars, pastors, historians, and activists, this film shows how specific readings of the Bible have led many Christians to confuse their devotion to Jesus with their dedication to the state. The film helps viewers rediscover and restore long-held Christian beliefs regarding nonviolence, inspiring Christians to become purveyors of peace rather than enablers of conflict and violence.",

The program has won many awards for investigative journalism, and broken many high-profile stories. A notable early example of this was the show's epoch-making 1962 expos\u00e9 on the appalling living conditions endured by many Aboriginal Australians living in rural New South Wales.",

The bandits take the money and escape, but Cisco stays behind with the Frenchman -- who, it turns out, is actually a lovely mademoiselle, Jeanne DuBois (Ramsay Ames). She follows him to the bandit's lair, where Cisco tells her he intends to return the stolen money to the poor people. The two rivals are irresistibly drawn to each other, however, and as a token of love Cisco offers to return the money to Jeanne instead. Now she must decide whether to complete her business deal, or to comply with Cisco's wishes and redistribute the wealth.",

But as he moves further and further into uncharted waters, first as a voice for the youth movement (or is he just a mouthpiece for opportunist politicians?) and then as a nominee for President of the United States, Max will not bend to the will of the old guard. Instead he begins implementing his own ideas of what would make a better world, including re-education camps for those over the age of 35 along with a liberal dosing of LSD.",

His role will span two ages, one in his late twenties as a musician based in London and the other at an older age as an introverted, composed, dutiful army officer in Kashmir.  Katrina as Meera play as a seductress, an unattainable beauty. And Anushka as Akira who is 21 year old and works for Discovery Channel and makes documentaries.",

Two of them have been beatified.",

Before that, it was the site of a Native American massacre. And before that, several women were burned at the stake for being witches. Nowadays, Mia\u2019s friends are not too keen on transforming this dilapidated summer camp into the wedding venue of her dreams. Mia\u2019s wound a bit too tight and somewhat of a control freak. Her gay BFF has the hots for all the groomsmen and her maid of honor just wants good cellphone reception. Even worse, she accidentally sent an email invite to her annoying high school friend whom she hasn\u2019t seen in years. But nothing will stop Mia from having a perfect wedding, not even when people begin disappearing in the night, and especially not when a spirit-possessed Teddy Ruxpin starts telling her to hide the bodies.",

From here on, Jugni is about striking balances, making tough decisions while trying to soften the blows and dealing with the studied dramatic turns and unpredictabilities of life and finding the place which one can call home; home of the heart, where the firefly is at her brightest.",

It was hosted by Adrian Chiles from 2006 to 2009, and Dara \u00d3 Briain took over as host in 2010 after Chiles' move to ITV. The programme airs in a 30 minute slot after each episode of The Apprentice finishes. It was originally shown on BBC Three, but moved to BBC Two in 2007. Its format is similar to that of Big Brother's Little Brother and Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. The final episode of each series is renamed \"The Apprentice: You're Hired!\" and involves interviews with the winner, the runner-up and Lord Sugar himself, and a reunion with all of the former candidates.",

The documentary details their experiences with an embattled VA - from botched surgeries to misdiagnoses to personnel shortfalls - and educates about the fundamental changes and reforms that are needed to ensure our veterans are taken care of in a way that honors their service. It asks viewers to reflect on serious and complex questions about what kind of care our veterans have earned after they hang up their uniforms and when, how, and where they receive that care. The Care They've Earned tells the stories of six veterans, but it highlights the struggles of finding adequate health care that all veterans face. It educates about the opportunity that more choices could mean for our veterans to receive the care they need - when and where they need it.",

In her research she discovers a book, now Tracy is taken into three interlocking tales of the unexpected. First in THE VAT, two women (Jenny Coulter / Rodney Horn) are harassed by a religious fanatic (Angie Keeling) about their worldly ways. When the bible thumping hypocrite threatens violence, chaos takes it's toll. Next in BIG DEBBIE, a robust woman (Rodney Horn) is abandoned at the altar, she runs into two guys that use her to fulfill their odd sexual fetish. When one accidentally dies, they're forced to get rid of the body... the only problem: a woman on the edge (Rachel Stout) witnesses the ditching and blackmails them into killing her cheating girlfriend (Kelli Ellis). Finally in INGLOURIOUS BITCHES, a quirky pair of female vigilantes (Douglas Conner / Brian Dorton) use an app on a cellphone to track down and murder sex offenders.",

To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack.
