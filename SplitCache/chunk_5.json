The alien's heart is softened by the persevering goodness of a beautiful blind woman, deeply conflicting his motives as the film plods to its \"climactic\" confrontation between the humans and their counterfeit duplicates.",

Sanwri's gentle nature melts Bhanwar's heart, but tension arises when Bhairo sees Sanwri as an object to satisfy his lustful needs. Their love cannot survive society's harsh judgment and discrimination towards Transgender/Intersex people. The film also sheds light on bride trafficking, skewed female ratios in India, and derogatory terms such as 'Chakka,' 'Gud,' 'Hijda.'",

Hopes of rescue fade as the survivors come to realise that the world may have suffered a major disaster. They have to rely on their own resources and at first manage to live harmoniously. But gradually tensions rise after a failed attempt to escape. Intolerance threatens their very existence as one of the men begins to put himself forward as the leader of the group.",

There, she pours out her heart, complaining that everything she values in her life has been turned inside out so as to serve and support her legless brother.",

For the past three decades, Weekender has bubbled just below the surface, gaining genuine cult status and influencing a vast network of creators. In the run-up to its thirtieth anniversary filmmakers Tabitha Denholm and Adam Dunlop interviewed people involved in the project. I Am Weekender is built around those conversations.",

In the summer of 1990, the film sees Camp Kindlewood forced to go co-ed for the first time in its seventy-year existence. Camp Director Roger (Colin Mochrie) tries to keep the camp off the corporate chopping block, but after an awkward encounter between head counsellors Dale (Eric Osborne) and Amber (Rachel Dagenais), all bets are off. Rallying their sides in an attempt to win back their camp and gain dominance over what they feel is rightfully theirs, this battle of the sexes sets off a series of pranks, fueled by camp caretaker Coffee (Kevin McDonald), as the boys and girls fight for their summertime home.",

    "description": "From award-winning director Phil Grabsky comes this fresh new look at arguably the world\u2019s favourite artist \u2013 through his own words.  Using letters and other private writings I, Claude Monet reveals new insight into the man who not only painted the picture that gave birth to impressionism but who was perhaps the most influential and successful painter of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Despite this, and perhaps because of it, Monet\u2019s life is a gripping tale about a man who, behind his sun-dazzled canvases, suffered from feelings of depression, loneliness, even suicide. Then, as his art developed and his love of gardening led to the glories of his garden at Giverney, his humour, insight and love of life is revealed.  Shot on location in Paris, London, Normandy and Venice I, Claude Monet is a cinematic immersion into some of the most loved and iconic scenes in Western Art.",

Forming a close friendship while detained, they used music and art as a form of peaceful resistance to promote humanity and tirelessly advocate on behalf of all those who remained held. Australian artist Angus McDonald\u2019s passionate documentary, whilst not shying away from the brutality of their experience, embraces their extraordinary resilience and optimism.",

There, the local authorities are investigating the disappearance of two parents whose daughter was recently found wandering a local beach alone in a state of shock. A strange pile of pungent debris has also washed ashore, leading some locals to suspect that the Skunk Ape may somehow be involved in the incident. Now, with every step closer they come to solving the mystery, the local police begin to realize that local urban legends about a formidable beast that lives on the woods may not be so far-fetched after all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",

With the help of her orphaned friend, Jimmy Bean, she casts her spell on the grumpiest townsfolk of Beldingsville -- including the cynical shut-in Mrs. Snow, the morose millionaire Mr. Pendleton and the enigmatic Dr. Chilton. And Pollyanna masterminds the romance between her Aunt's maid, Nancy, and the handyman, Tim. It is only Aunt Polly, who cannot bring herself to embrace Pollyanna's innocence and joy. But all is not straightforward in Pollyanna's war against pessimism, since she must overcome a personal tragedy that threatens to banish \"glad\" from her vocabulary forever.",

When Diz robs a local drug-dealing crazy, he becomes the owner of a giant pile of cash and the target of two vicious killers. With more money than he knows what to do with, and criminals at his heels, Diz puts the people he's learned to care about in danger, still trying to win Selah. But some things can't be stolen or bought. The River Thief is a film about guilt, self-sacrifice, and accepting life as a gift.",

When Dhurjan finds out about Sitaram contesting this election, he is enraged, he asks Shakuni, his brother-in-law, to convince Sitaram to change his mind, but Sitaram refuses to do so. Subsequently, Police Inspector Patak Singh registers a complaint against Sitaram for looting and leading some bandits, raids his house, finds stolen property and jewelery, arrests him and holds him in a cell. Baba Thakur, another bandit, comes to his rescue, but is unable to save Sitaram's life, who is killed. Geeta wants to avenge her father's untimely death. The only way she can do this is by becoming a bandit herself, and making herself a target - not only by the corrupt police force, but by bandit gang-leader Shaitan Singh, who owes allegiance to Dhurjan; another bandit gang-leader, Hasina; as well as Dhurjan and his men.",

And hence, he became Shivaji's biggest enemy. Adilshah later, declared a war against Shivaji Maharaj and captured the Panhala fort. After several attempts for recapturing the fort, Shivaji Maharaj failed. Adilshah, being a tricky politician, appointed the brutal Beshakh Khan as the guardian of the fort. The illegal and immoral acts of Beshakh Khan was against Swaraj and a hurdle for the coronation of Shivaji Maharaj. To stop him and capture the fort of Panhala was now an issue of prestige for Shivaji Maharaj. Farzand is the movie about Shivaji Maharaj's 60 great warriors lead by Kondaji Farzand, which portrays their great achievements in capturing Panhala fort.",

By chance they came across a new tomb that was the first to contain a body since the discovery of Tutankhamun. Then they discovered that the tomb beside it, which had never been excavated before, held the bodies of around 50 people. But who were all the people in these two linked tombs? This film follows the archaeological detective story to uncover the answer. It pursues the trail that leads to one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs, Amenhotep III - and to the women he was close to. And the film also reveals the astonishing project behind the re-emergence nearby of the largest temple ever built in ancient Egypt - the lost mortuary temple of the same pharaoh, Amenhotep III.",

A nearly decade-long romance with the infamous Dr. Dre pushed her into a life tarnished by alcohol, drugs and violence until her savior came in the unlikely form of Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records and Dre's business partner. Friendship would turn into a courtly romance, but the union Michel'le thought they had did not end happily ever after. With children from both men and a career to protect, Michel'le's voice became silenced by Compton's biggest power players. Until now.",

After a life-changing accident, Gurumai remembered the knowledge of her previous three births and the sacred practice of Kriya Yoga. Determined to share this with the world, she began her mission - but dark forces and malicious people stood in her way. Opposition, humiliation, and attempts to exile her from Kashi couldn't stop her. Strengthened by the blessings of Mahavatar Babaji, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Shankar Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Haidakhan Baba, and Baba Bhadrabahu, Gurumai continued her work fearlessly. Even when she was criticized for wearing black robes on the command of her Gurus - she chose faith over fear. Fakeeriyat is not just a story. It is a powerful reflection of devotion, courage, and unwavering Guru-krupa. A journey of a seeker who became a light for others - despite every storm.",

    "description": "The Apprentice: You're Fired!, sometimes named You're Fired!, The Apprentice: You're Hired! or You're Hired!, is a British television show made by the BBC and filmed at Riverside Studios as a spin-off from the reality TV hit The Apprentice. It was hosted by Adrian Chiles from 2006 to 2009, and Dara \u00d3 Briain took over as host in 2010 after Chiles' move to ITV. The programme airs in a 30 minute slot after each episode of The Apprentice finishes. It was originally shown on BBC Three, but moved to BBC Two in 2007. Its format is similar to that of Big Brother's Little Brother and Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. The final episode of each series is renamed \"The Apprentice: You're Hired!\" and involves interviews with the winner, the runner-up and Lord Sugar himself, and a reunion with all of the former candidates.",

What about futurist Ray Kurzweil, a laughter yoga expert, or an elder porn star? Wexler explores the viewpoints of delightfully unusual characters alongside those of health, fitness and life-extension experts in this engaging new documentary, which challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thought-provoking examination of what truly gives life meaning.",

The film in entirety has been been shot in London, Birmingham and Scotland. Ajay Devgn plays the role of a businessman who is married to actress Kangana Ranaut. Anil Kapoor plays the cop. The stylist Navin Shetty said to Mid Day, \u201cDirector Priyadarshan gave me a brief on Ajay's character in Tezz saying he didn't want anything fancy but more realistic - someone who will blend with the crowd. Ajay plays a father of a child and the film is set against a grey London winter so we have give Ajay's character an earthy look. He has a moustache and faint stubble. The colours are grey, brown, rust and khaki. We have played with the cut and the colours while the fabrics used have been wool and leather with lots of scarves and headgears. The effect is simple, realistic, smart and classy.\"",

Michael Dillon - previously named Laura - had persuaded the brilliant Sir Harold Gillies, the founding father of plastic surgery, to carry out the female-to-male operation that no surgeon in the world had ever attempted. Both then helped former race car driver and wartime pilot Robert Cowell undertake their own transition.",

In 2014 she was again found guilty in absentia after a retrial and sentenced to 28 years and six months in jail. The saga came to and end when Italy's highest court overturned the convictions of Ms Knox and her former boyfriend, Italian student Raffaele Sollecito in March 2015. Known burglar Rudy Guede was arrested a short time later following the discovery of his bloodstained fingerprints on Kercher's possessions. He was later found guilty of murder in a fast-track trial and is currently (as of 2019) serving a 16-year prison sentence.",

Over the course of two days in July 2017, five young men go missing in an idyllic, sleepy suburb of Philadelphia.

    "description": "\"He Sends Rain\" is a narrative feature film about a young man whose perspective is challenged when he is forced to confront old wounds. At the onset of this story, David Conrad is a man who trusts his intellect, and his anger about a family tragedy has transformed into deeply rooted bitterness. During a visit to David's family home, Julia, his wife, notices negative changes in David's personality and attempts to uncover the mystery of David's past. In this film, David is forced to confront where he's wrong about himself, about his relationships, and about faith. As Socrates put it, \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" \"He Sends Rain\" explores this idea, and it does so in an entertaining and thoughtful way.",

Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor, theologian and anti-Nazi dissident who was a key founding member of the Confessing Church movement. Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to the Nazi dictatorship, including vocal opposition to Hitler's genocidal persecution of the Jews. He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years. Later, he was transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp. Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and was then quickly tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945, four weeks before the surrender of the Third Reich.",
