Harsh realities and fantastic illusions come together in BLACK MAGIC FOR WHITE BOYS, Onur Tukel\u2019s latest film, a bizarre comic adventure about gentrification, race and bodily autonomy in New York City. With over 50 minutes of new footage, Tukel has completely reworked a project initially presented in 2017 as a four-episode series at Tribeca into a gnarly and charmingly weird dark comedy. Balancing edgy misanthropy with a strain of silly sweetness, this is an intimate low-budget parable about the changing face of New York City.",

Friedman and Henenlotter navigate us through more than five salacious decades of skin flicks. It's the true story of dirty movies, traced in elegant detail from the bizarre locations where these nudie shorts were screened to the ongoing legal battles fought by their promoters. And of course there are the stories of the innovators themselves, people who often risked their own security and livelihood to make these films, believing in some way that what they were doing wasn't a 'bad' thing - and that it could rake in some dough.",

    "description": "The Apprentice: You're Fired!, sometimes named You're Fired!, The Apprentice: You're Hired! or You're Hired!, is a British television show made by the BBC and filmed at Riverside Studios as a spin-off from the reality TV hit The Apprentice. It was hosted by Adrian Chiles from 2006 to 2009, and Dara \u00d3 Briain took over as host in 2010 after Chiles' move to ITV. The programme airs in a 30 minute slot after each episode of The Apprentice finishes. It was originally shown on BBC Three, but moved to BBC Two in 2007. Its format is similar to that of Big Brother's Little Brother and Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two. The final episode of each series is renamed \"The Apprentice: You're Hired!\" and involves interviews with the winner, the runner-up and Lord Sugar himself, and a reunion with all of the former candidates.",

Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor, theologian and anti-Nazi dissident who was a key founding member of the Confessing Church movement. Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to the Nazi dictatorship, including vocal opposition to Hitler's genocidal persecution of the Jews. He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years. Later, he was transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp. Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and was then quickly tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945, four weeks before the surrender of the Third Reich.",

Taking in Maharajas and Viceroys, fakirs and farmhands and personalities such as Sabu and Gandhi, the film explores not only the people and places of over 70 years ago, but asks us to engage with broader themes of a shared history, shifting perspectives in the lead up to Indian independence and the ghosts of the past. Around India boasts a superb new score that fuses western and Indian music from composer and sarod player Soumik Datta.",

Broadcast on ABC1 in Australia, it premiered on 19 August 1961 and celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2021. Founding producer Robert Raymond and his successor Allan Ashbolt did much to set the ongoing tone of the program.\r\n\r\nBased on the Panorama concept, the program addresses a single issue in depth each week, showing either a locally produced program or a relevant documentary from overseas. The program has won many awards for investigative journalism, and broken many high-profile stories. A notable early example of this was the show's epoch-making 1962 expos\u00e9 on the appalling living conditions endured by many Aboriginal Australians living in rural New South Wales.",

When a group of close-knit friends assemble for the marriage of Skylar and Dan, they have no idea they will witness The Rapture and face a series of catastrophic events turning the celebration into a life-or-death struggle. Scrambling for sanctuary and self-preservation while an army of nocturnal creatures they never knew existed unleashes epic destruction, they must understand what is happening around them, and why, to find a way to survive together in a new world order.

What about futurist Ray Kurzweil, a laughter yoga expert, or an elder porn star? Wexler explores the viewpoints of delightfully unusual characters alongside those of health, fitness and life-extension experts in this engaging new documentary, which challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thought-provoking examination of what truly gives life meaning.",

Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels-armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent-stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world's most dangerous group, N.W.A. And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today. Straight Outta Compton stars O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, and is directed by F. Gary Gray.",

The long and winding road that the Beatles took to worldwide fame passed through Hamburg, Germany in the early 1960s. Only a couple of years before they became household names, the former \u201cQuarrymen\u201d were cutting their musical teeth on nightclub stages in Hamburg. In the 15 years after the end of WW2 Hamburg had become the vice capital of Europe. Its neon lit streets were home to sailors, prostitutes, drug dealers, gangs and low life. The group was still developing. At the time of their first Hamburg adventure, George Harrison, was only 17 years old. They were all still very young men, and their group was virtually unknown. By the time of their last German visit in 1966, the Beatles were a worldwide phenomenon.",

Leroy, confined in a small cell with the enemy, far from the KKK comrades who deserted him, finds the chatty Emilio slowly chipping away at his anger and prejudice.

Pollyanna shares a game her father taught her -- the 'Glad Game' -- in which everyone can find a silver lining in even the darkest cloud, and her sunny nature, good humor and determination to look on the bright side of life prove to have an astonishing effect on those around her. With the help of her orphaned friend, Jimmy Bean, she casts her spell on the grumpiest townsfolk of Beldingsville -- including the cynical shut-in Mrs. Snow, the morose millionaire Mr. Pendleton and the enigmatic Dr. Chilton. And Pollyanna masterminds the romance between her Aunt's maid, Nancy, and the handyman, Tim. It is only Aunt Polly, who cannot bring herself to embrace Pollyanna's innocence and joy. But all is not straightforward in Pollyanna's war against pessimism, since she must overcome a personal tragedy that threatens to banish \"glad\" from her vocabulary forever.",

As time moves on, Condon slowly becomes the villain in his own movie by playing off the actor\u2019s need to give the best performances they possibly can, while also satisfying his increasingly sinister demands; even if it kills them.

To musicians, the bow is as essential to expressing the soul of the music as the violin or cello.  The film follows the journey of the \u201csilent servant\u201d of the music world\u2014from the workshops of the virtuosos of the trade, to the birthplace of the bow in France, and to Brazil, home to the imperiled tree from which the world\u2019s finest bows are made.",

    "description": "Every town has a devil. For the small community of Braxton, that devil is Tommy Miller. A bullied and tormented teen who finally snapped, killing his friends and family at the annual Braxton town hall party, Miller escaped into the woods, never to be seen or heard from again. Until now. Ten years later, a group of fresh-faced teens find themselves targeted by a masked man in a hooded cloak. It's up to Detective Ryan Fenton and his fish-out-of-water partner to protect the town from Miller's clutches; there's just one issue - Ryan himself is a survivor of the original massacre. Is Miller opening up a new chapter, or has he returned to attend to some unfinished business?",

The movie opens at her funeral, and Troy, ill-equipped to deal with this kind of grief at this stage in his life, just shuts down.

With nowhere else to turn, Troy drives to where his aunt lives in the desert. There, he meets with his Aunt Hilda, a supporting cast of crazy fun old ladies, and Bobby, a kind of wise cowboy, all of whom make it easier for Troy to find the place within to deal with his grief and move forward, and help open Troy's eyes that his pain is not unique. In the Process, Troy also learns the Difference between \"true love\" and \"love at first sight\".",

When camps around the country were shutting down every year and Camp Kitchikewana made the economically necessary move to turn co-ed, the result was a very real clash of the sexes.  In the summer of 1990, the film sees Camp Kindlewood forced to go co-ed for the first time in its seventy-year existence. Camp Director Roger (Colin Mochrie) tries to keep the camp off the corporate chopping block, but after an awkward encounter between head counsellors Dale (Eric Osborne) and Amber (Rachel Dagenais), all bets are off. Rallying their sides in an attempt to win back their camp and gain dominance over what they feel is rightfully theirs, this battle of the sexes sets off a series of pranks, fueled by camp caretaker Coffee (Kevin McDonald), as the boys and girls fight for their summertime home.",

When Dhurjan finds out about Sitaram contesting this election, he is enraged, he asks Shakuni, his brother-in-law, to convince Sitaram to change his mind, but Sitaram refuses to do so. Subsequently, Police Inspector Patak Singh registers a complaint against Sitaram for looting and leading some bandits, raids his house, finds stolen property and jewelery, arrests him and holds him in a cell. Baba Thakur, another bandit, comes to his rescue, but is unable to save Sitaram's life, who is killed. Geeta wants to avenge her father's untimely death. The only way she can do this is by becoming a bandit herself, and making herself a target - not only by the corrupt police force, but by bandit gang-leader Shaitan Singh, who owes allegiance to Dhurjan; another bandit gang-leader, Hasina; as well as Dhurjan and his men.",

But after a chance encounter with Jack, a handsome and worldly businessman, Posy's shell begins to crack.

Posy's growing desire to break free allows her to exercise her inner self with Jack, an alter ego she's created called the Queen of Sin.
