    "description": "Are all relationships based on lies? Jake Bianski runs a fish market in north Boston, surrounded by Italians. For years, he's carried a torch for Isabella, an ex-girlfriend now married with three children and no interest in Jake. Yet, he tells everyone she's his girlfriend, including Marisa, a veterinarian his employees set him up with at the Italian singles club. She's interested in him until he tells her about his girlfriend, then he's persistent in asking her to be his friend. As the friendship bumps along, Jake realizes that reality may be better than fantasy, but what if Isabella changes her mind about Jake, and what if it comes out that Marisa, like Jake, isn't Italian?",

    "description": "Sara lived a seemingly normal life before she had a Ouija board experience that unleashed a dark spirit. The spirit wants Sara to relive it's tortured past, and compels her to commit murder towards one of her family members or loved ones. Sara resists these threats and tries to stand against the power but she's forced to either watch her loved ones die one after the other, or obey the spirit and kill only one of them herself, as the spirit had done to her own son, long before. Sara must kill only one, and face the regret and pain of committing murder, or watch everyone around her die.",

This was one of the films where Amjad Khan plays a positive role. Nearly all of his other films with Amitabh Bachchan have been where he plays a villain role. This movie became a hit at the box office. One of the plus points of the film was its music by Rajesh Roshan and lyrics by Anjaan. At least three songs \"Chhookar Mere Mann Ko\", \"Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan\", \"Saara Zamana\" and \"Haseeno Ka Deewana\" were superhit songs and still liked.",

Ill-conceived orders came down from higher command: On June 29, 1966, Capt. Kelley was to spread his platoons 1,000 meters apart in order to cover more area while looking for Vietcong forces.\r\n During the patrol, the 3rd platoon stumbled upon an embedded Vietcong main force battalion. Outnumbered by nearly 10 to 1, the platoon was blindsided by a fierce attack. The triple-canopy jungle was dense and the terrain muddy, making rescue all but impossible.\r\n The film is a journey to understand what the filmmaker's father and seven survivors went through in 1966, and what they continue to go through today. Some volunteered for the army as teenagers. Others were drafted. Some went back to Vietnam years later with the hope of finding closure and peace.",

It is rumoured that in the last days of the siege a small group managed to slip away in the dead of night to retrieve this hidden treasure and get it safely away from the clutches of the Catholic Church.

Working at Martinez Bail Bonds, Jackson has unorthodox methods of tracking down low-life criminals, but they work, and one day he hopes to become his own boss and open up his own private investigation firm. Reggie Wright (Epps) is a slippery con artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake, much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Flanagan). When Wright meets up with his girlfriend (Mendes), he discovers that his recently purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million. Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it back.",

    "description": "The family man farmer John Rollins is stressed with his financial situation: the crows and the lack of irrigation are destroying his crop of corn; the bank is near closure of his mortgage; he does not have credit to fix the water pump or to buy seeds; and his marriage is in crisis and his wife Mary is giving too much attention to her friend Tommy. When John accidentally discovers a hidden compartment in the barn, he finds a creepy scarecrow but his son Michael makes him promise to destroy it. However, his neighbor Jude Weatherby visits him, gives a six-pack of beer to the abstemious John and convinces him to put the scarecrow in the cornfield. Out of the blue, the life of John changes: the crows die; the pump works again irrigating the land; and the banker responsible for the closure has an accident and dies. However, he feels that his land is possessed by something evil that is threatening his beloved family.",

The contest comes down to a schmaltzy campaign by Hoffman with music by Air Supply that uses the tagline \"Vorcan: your own personal air supply.\" or a more down to earth campaign from Cranston of \"The pad ain't bad!\"",

The colours are grey, brown, rust and khaki. We have played with the cut and the colours while the fabrics used have been wool and leather with lots of scarves and headgears.

We saw Pushpavalli's harmless infatuation for the charming Bhindi exporter Nikhil Rao turn into an obsession. From stealing Nikhil's dog to breaking her leg to get his attention, Pushpavalli set herself up to be embarrassed and yelled at by everyone around her. Hurt and distressed, her boss/childhood friend Pankaj advised her to go back home to Bhopal. Did she? No. Instead she installed CCTV at Nikhil's house. This season opens with Pushpavalli getting engaged to Vidyuth, a sweet gentle boy from Bangalore and surprisingly she appears to have moved on. She has decided to stay back in Bangalore to spend time with Vidyuth and his family while her overbearing Amma is at the Guruji's ashram. But why is she back at Pankaj's Children's Library, which is on the same street as Nikhil's Bhindi Packhouse? Why is she living again at Vasu's PG, but this time secretly? How did Nikhil and her become friends again? Why is she interested in Nikhil's Bhindi consignment to Europe? Is she helping him or is she just angry with the way she was treated and is now up to something? Or is she just not over the Bhindi exporter?",

Everything is coming up roses until Sharon Vickers, Amber's mother, arrives for a visit. Gaudy, straight-laced and opinionated, Sharon is the complete opposite of Jill. What was supposed to be a benign first meeting of the in-law's quickly turns into a competition, as Sharon and Jill have widely differing views on life, love and marriage. As the weekend visit is coming to an end, Sharon takes matters into her own hands, rendering Jill incapable of escaping her house, and proving to her once and for all that no one comes between Sharon and her daughter.",
