Finally, though, Sadie's Achilles heel is a rough, unlovely voice very different than her sister's crowd-pleasing singing.",

Their roots now firmly planted as they set up homestead in the far West, Missie begins to realize her passion for teaching as Willie cares for the couple's young daughter Kathy while expanding the family ranch with a little help from sons Jeff and Matthew. When the frontier railroad comes to town, the pleasure of a long-promised visit from Missie's father Clark is suddenly offset by the tragic death of young Kathy. As the untimely demise of their beloved daughter begins to drive an emotional wedge between Missie and Willie, the devastated father unexpectedly accepts an offer made by the powerful Samuel Doros to assume the role of town sheriff. Their faith shaken and their once close-knit bond suddenly torn asunder, Missie and Willie desperately attempt to bring their crumbling family back together as son Jeff faces a series of dangers while hopelessly falling for Doros' beautiful daughter Colette.",

Disillusioned after years of making low budget genre films, the producer readily accepts the demands of his less than legitimate financiers. Namely, the production be filmed entirely in Romania to take advantage of a complicated and slightly suspicious tax deal. Shot in documentary style, this behind-the-scenes comedy deftly and inexorably exposes the painful reality of runaway film production. Way off the radar in deepest, darkest, rural Romania the hopelessly disconnected production veers swiftly off the tracks as bizarre personalities, cultural, economic and language issues quickly combine to send the production spiraling into hysteria.

When David learns of this, he publicly announces Solomon to be his successor. Adonijah and Joab, his general, withdraw in rage.

However, it has been years since his last success and he is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A copyist is urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.",

    "description": "On the Trail of Bigfoot: The Journey follows cryptid documentarian Seth Breedlove and his crew as they head to the Adirondacks of update New York for an intensive, adventure-filled week searching for Sasquatch. The team joins bigfoot researchers like Steve Kulls (\"Monsterquest\") and Paul Bartholomew (Finding Bigfoot, Beast of Whitehall) who lead them on the search for their quarry. The Journey takes a deep look into the subject of bigfoot, but also what spurs people to spend their lives searching for a creature many believe doesn't exist. Along the way, the crew makes a stop in Whitehall, NY, home to an incident involving multiple members of law enforcement claiming to see a bigfoot in a field off a rural road. The crew has multiple unusual experiences during their various night investigations near Lake George, Whitehall, and Western Massachusetts. The Journey unveils some of that evidence.",

He didn't talk about the hurt and the pain that Barr was causing his family. He didn't even tell Barr about the damage that he was doing to himself. He just opened the Bible to a certain scripture, gave it to Barr and told him to read that scripture every morning before he left home. The scripture was Psalms 121. 121 details how Burton Barr Jr. overcame his addiction to heroin, cocaine, crack, alcohol, cigarettes and sex by learning to harness the power and live out the words of the 121st Psalm.",

Shortly thereafter she gave birth to Jasmeet. Manmohan was always embarrassed of Bebo, as she was overly healthy and not quite sophisticated, as a result he always left her at home, while he socialized. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so got her admitted in an English Medium school, encouraged to mingle with Caucasian friends, and as a result Jasmeet was transformed in to Jazz - a stunningly beautiful young woman, British in looks, talk, habits, and heart. Manmohan's plans to get her married to an Indian boy are all in vain. His friend, Parvez Khan, is in a similar situation with his son, Imran, openly romancing a Caucasian blonde, Susan. Manmohan decides to take his family for a tour in India...",

The murderer would always get someone close to the victim to witness how he would strangle the victim from behind with a rope but he would let the witnesses go and speak to the media on how the murders happened. Ito plays the role of Makimura, the police detective who was in charge of investigating the serial murders but failed to catch the cunning murderer and his respected superior ended up being killed as well. 22 years later in 2017 when the case is nearing its statute of limitations, a man named Sonezaki claims to be the culprit for the 1995 murders and even publishes a book titled \"Watashi ga satsujinhan desu\" to talk about the cases. Despite the disgust towards Sonezaki's actions, the intensive attention showered on him via the media and SNS makes him become the talk of town.",

He marries her and returns to Bombay where he announces that he will never sing without Uma again. However, Subeer encourages Uma to sing alone and when her popularity is soon greater than his own, the seed of jealousy begins to grow... The major difference between Uma and Subeer is that she sings for herself, whereas he sings for the public. It is the difference between geet and sangeet. This is the root of the thing that later causes problems, and based on which the movie is named.",

Many believe the Mothman to be a 1960\u2019s phenomenon, an omen only appearing before tragedy, and disappearing after a flap of sightings and the subsequent Silver Bridge collapse in 1967. But what if there\u2019s more? What if the origins of this omen trace back much further and go much deeper than anyone realized? And what if\u2026the sightings never ended?",

On the cusp of her widowed mother Ruth's sixtieth birthday and the return of her dysfunctional siblings Drew, Doonie and Raf, Beth is swept away by visions of their idyllic childhood and re-lives the moments that defined her adolescence. Despite Ruth's warnings, and as real-world tensions grow between the siblings, Beth becomes dependant on the greenhouse, soon realising it isn't the paradise she believed it to be.",

The film reveals that Lynne is a true man of music, for whom the recording studio is his greatest instrument. With access to Lynne in his studio above LA, this is an intimate account of a great British pop classicist who has ploughed a unique furrow since starting out on the Birmingham Beat scene in the early 60s, moving from the Idle Race to the multi-million selling ELO in the 70s and then, with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and George Harrison, as a key member of the Traveling Wilburys.",

When Jane stumbles across the Nova United Senior Women's Basketball League, old passions are reignited.

Ever since she sustained a head injury during a cheerleading stunt the previous year, she's suffered from a disorder that causes her to fly into uncontrollable, sometimes violent rages. As hard as she tries to keep it together, she finds herself in danger of jeopardizing her seemingly perfect life. It isn't until Brooke meets Jake, a handsome and charismatic stranger, that she feels like she's found someone who not only understands her, but accepts her for who she is. As tempting as it is to get swept up in the romance, she can't help but feel like something in their relationship isn't quite right. When her best friend is brutally murdered, Brooke has no choice but to depend on her new love...especially because she's worried that she might be the killer.",

    "description": "Lights Out was an extremely popular American old-time radio program, an early example of a network series devoted mostly to horror and the supernatural, predating Suspense and Inner Sanctum. Versions of Lights Out aired on different networks, at various times, from January 1934 to the summer of 1947 and the series eventually made the transition to television.\r\n\r\nIn 1946, NBC Television brought Lights Out to TV in a series of four specials, broadcast live and produced by Fred Coe, who also contributed three of the scripts. NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, \"First Person Singular\", which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. Variety gave this first episode a rave review (\"undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen\"), but Lights Out did not become a regular NBC-TV series until 1949.",

As the night wears on and the bodies begin to pile up in their wake, Tyler starts to believe that there is more to John Rancour and his motives than he originally accused; and that the people and places he witnesses could lead to a bigger story than he ever thought possible.

Nick ignores Pete's protests and rushes Psi Theta Epsilon, notorious for its rumored hazing practices.

    "description": "EXHIBITION ON SCREEN is thrilled to present one of the most talked-about exhibitions of the year. Dedicated to the portrait work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, the exhibition opens in Paris before traveling to London and Washington.  One can\u2019t appreciate 20th century art without understanding the significance and genius of Paul C\u00e9zanne. Featuring interviews with curators and experts from the National Portrait Gallery London, MoMA New York, National Gallery of Art Washington, and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay Paris, and correspondence from the artist himself, the film takes audiences beyond the exhibition to the places C\u00e9zanne lived and worked and sheds light on an artist who is perhaps the least-known of all the impressionists \u2013 until now."

For the first time ever, fans of The Animal can relive his storied career with this 3-DVD set that includes a biography of Batista s life both inside the ring and out. In addition to this revealing look at The Animal, this 3-DVD set will feature dozens of the greatest matches and moments from Batista s career."
